# Install packages to the Django backend

First, install your packages using the `pip install` command.

After the packages are installed, run the following command to create a `requirements.txt` file with all the installed packages:
```bash
pip freeze > backend/requirements.txt
```

To install all required packages, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```
